3,"The BC total crime statistics include additional reporting from the following specialized units: Canadian National Railway Police, Canadian Pacific Railway Police, and Metro Vancouver Transit Police. These specialized units provide supplemental policing in BC; that is, they are mandated to provide policing in geographic areas already served by provincial or municipal police services but for a specific purpose. For example, in the Lower Mainland area of the province, Metro Vancouver Transit Police provides policing on and around the transit system, which is supplemental to the jurisdictional police. Similarly, the Canadian National and Canadian Pacific railway police services provide specialized law enforcement within the province. These police services provide policing along the railway and do not have a specific jurisdiction population for which they are responsible.",,,,,,,,,

In 2013/14, the RCMP revised the map boundaries that reside in PRIME-BC for each of the jurisdictions within the Ridge Meadows Detachment. This realignment of jurisdictional boundaries likely resulted in changes in reporting; as a result, criminal incident volumes prior to 2014 for these individual jurisdictions should be used with caution.

The designated land title names for these reserve lands are: Mission 1 (North Vancouver City), Seymour Creek 2, and Burrard Inlet 3 (North Vancouver District). Due to inconsistencies in scoring crime data to the appropriate jurisdictions, the populations for these reserve lands were assigned to North Vancouver Prov (from 2006 to 2018); prior to 2006, the populations were assigned to North Vancouver District. In 2019, the populations for the reserve lands were realigned from North Vancouver Prov and added to the appropriate municipality. This realignment may result in changes in reporting; crime statistics should be used with caution.",,,,,,,,,

15,"Since the incorporation of Northern Rockies Mun in 2009, until they signed a Municipal Police Unit Agreement effective April 1, 2010, Northern Rockies Mun continued to be policed by the Provincial Police Service. From April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2012, the municipality was policed by Northern Rockies Mun with the remaining area policed by Northern Rockies Prov. Due to data inconsistencies, for the years 2010 to 2012, data for Northern Rockies Mun were included in data for Northern Rockies Prov. According to the 2011 Canada Census, Northern Rockies Mun went under 5,000 population and, as a result, returned to being a provincial responsibility as of April 1, 2012 (the municipality was no longer responsible for providing police services within its municipal boundaries). A subsequent investigation by Statistics Canada showed that the jurisdiction was over 5,000 population and, as a result, responsible for its own policing; Northern Rockies Mun then signed a Municipal Police Unit Agreement with the provincial government for the provision of RCMP Municipal services effective April 1, 2013. In this report, for the years 2013 to 2016, Northern Rockies Mun is showing its own data. However, according to the 2016 Canada Census, Northern Rockies Mun went under 5,000 population and, as a result, responsibility for policing the municipality again reverted back to the provincial service (Northern Rockies Prov) effective April 1, 2017 (the municipality was no longer responsible for providing police services within its municipal boundaries).",,,,,,,,,
