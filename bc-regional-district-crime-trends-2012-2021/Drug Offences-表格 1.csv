"Drug offences are crimes committed under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and the Cannabis Act. CDSA drug offences include possession, trafficking, production, and distribution of cannabis, cocaine, heroin, non-heroin opioids (including fentanyl), and methamphetamines (crystal meth), and other drug offences. When the Cannabis Act came into force on October 17, 2018, all prior cannabis-related legislation under the CDSA was replaced with the Cannabis Act, and cannabis possession became legal, except under certain circumstances. Drug offences are not included in the Total Criminal Code offences.",,,,,,,,,,,
