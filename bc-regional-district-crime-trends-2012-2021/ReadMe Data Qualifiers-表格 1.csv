"Comparisons of crime statistics between jurisdictions, provinces, and years should be made with caution, as many factors influence police-reported crime statistics other than actual changes in crime. Many shifts in crime trends in 2020 may be attributable to the global COVID-19 pandemic, which brought widespread and unprecedented changes to daily life. As well, crime trends in 2018 and 2019 may be attributable in part to Statistics Canada’s changes in its reporting methodology for police services across Canada to represent a “victim-centred approach” to recording crimes.  Many police agencies across Canada implemented these changes at varying points throughout 2018, and BC’s roll-out of these changes occurred in 2019.",,,,
"Population figures are estimates prepared annually by BC Stats, based on the results of the Canada Census, which is conducted every five years. These estimates reflect only the permanent residential population of a jurisdiction. Where a jurisdiction serves as a resort, business, or entertainment centre, it may have substantial “part-time” or transient/seasonal populations in addition to its permanent resident population, such as tourists, cabin owners, commuters, students, and seasonal staff. These temporary population groups are counted in population figures within the jurisdiction of their place of residence and not the jurisdiction in which they may be temporarily visiting or working. Note: The 2020 population estimates provided by BC Stats were based on the Statistics Canada 2016 Census boundary geographies adjusted in accordance with current police jurisdiction boundaries.",,,,
"The crime data contained in these reports have been recorded by the police using the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Survey scoring rules and guidelines. Offences are counted by number of separate criminal incidents. For violent criminal events, a separate incident is counted for each victim of violence. Offences are categorized by the most serious offence in an incident. Criminal incidents represent crimes reported to, or discovered by, the police; this includes third party reports. However, criminal incident counts do not include incidents where after police investigation, police have found credible evidence to prove that the crime did not occur nor was it attempted. As well, crime data in these reports do not represent nor imply a count of the number of charges laid, prosecutions conducted, information sworn, or convictions obtained.",,,,
"Total Criminal Code offences (excluding traffic) include property, violent, and other crimes. ",,,,
"Crime rate is the number of Criminal Code offences or crimes (excluding drugs and traffic) reported for every 1,000 persons. It is a better measure of trends in crime than the actual number of offences because it accounts for population differences. Crime rates for the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and the Cannabis Act are calculated per 1,000 population basis. Since the number of homicides and attempted murders reported is small, rates are calculated on a per 100,000 population basis. Crime rates for Criminal Code traffic offences are also calculated per 100,000 population basis.

A high crime rate may indicate that a municipality is a “core city”, i.e., a business and/or entertainment centre for many people who reside outside, as well as inside, the municipality. As a result, “core cities” may have large part-time or temporary populations which are excluded from both their population bases and their crime rate calculations.",,,,
"Violent crimes include the offences of homicide, attempted murder, sexual and non-sexual assault, sexual offences against children, abduction, forcible confinement or kidnapping, firearms, robbery, criminal harassment, extortion, uttering threats, indecent or harassing communications, and other violent offences.",,,,
"Property crimes include the offences of breaking and entering, theft, motor vehicle theft, possession of stolen property, trafficking in stolen property, fraud, mischief, identity theft or fraud, arson, and altering/removing/destroying a vehicle identification number.",,,,
"Other crimes include Criminal Code offences not classified as either violent or property crimes, such as offences related to counterfeiting, offensive weapons, child pornography, disturbing the peace, the administration of justice, and other “other” offences.",,,,
Homicide data are extracted from the Homicide Survey database. Homicides are counted according to the year in which police file the report.,,,,
"Administration of justice includes the following offences: fail to comply with order, escape or helps to escape from lawful custody, prisoner unlawfully at large, fail to appear, breach of probation, and other violations against the administration of law and justice.",,,,
"Drug offences are crimes committed under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) and the Cannabis Act. CDSA drug offences include possession, trafficking, production, and distribution of cannabis, cocaine, heroin, non-heroin opioids (including fentanyl), and methamphetamines (crystal meth), and other drug offences. When the Cannabis Act came into force on October 17, 2018, all prior cannabis-related legislation under the CDSA was replaced with the Cannabis Act, and cannabis possession became legal, except under certain circumstances. Drug offences are not included in the Total Criminal Code offences.",,,,
"Crime data from the previous years may be revised by Statistics Canada to reflect any updates or changes that have been received from the police services. Due to this and other factors, the data contained in this report may vary when compared with previous reports produced by Policing and Security Branch. Where variances occur, the report produced at the latest date will reflect the most current data available.",,,,
